# 🎨 Module 3 – Spatial Storyboarding & Diorama Design  
**Course:** User Experience & Interaction Design for AR/VR/MR/XR  
**Specialization:** Extended Reality for Everybody (University of Michigan)  
**File:** `README_professional_summary_module3_course2.md`

## 📍 Overview

This module transitioned my early concepts into **visual storytelling artifacts** through **physical dioramas** and **scene sketches**. It represents the moment when the Rhomaleosaurus experience shifted from abstract interface ideas to a grounded, spatial narrative.  

I created a series of **annotated storyboards and hand‑built dioramas** to explore how users might emotionally and physically experience the journey from fossil to living creature — including awe, transformation, and predator tension.

## 🎯 Objective

- Build low-fidelity, **spatial storyboards** to simulate immersive scene flow  
- Construct **physical dioramas** to visualize the environment, layout, and user placement  
- Use narrative design to prototype **emotional beats** and **interaction timing**  
- Explore **scene transitions** as a tool for immersion and learning

## 🐉 Narrative Arc

The Rhomaleosaurus prototype was broken into three distinct scenes:

### 🧱 Scene 1 – Museum Fossil Exhibit  
A static, artifact-based introduction where users begin in a quiet museum space. The fossil lies dormant on display.

### 🌊 Scene 2 – Transformation to Living Creature  
The user triggers a transition (e.g., via gaze, button, time-delay) and the fossil animates. The space floods into a deep-sea environment where the Rhomaleosaurus swims freely.

### 🦈 Scene 3 – Predator in Action  
The user observes the Rhomaleosaurus in motion, hunting prey. This phase explores the balance between action and comfort in XR, emphasizing distance, motion cues, and user role.

## 🖼️ Key Visual Assets

### 🔹 Dioramas  
- `Diorama 1_Awe at Ancient Creatures.png`  
- `Diorama 2_Encounter with Rhomaleosaurus.png`  
- `Diorama 3_Rhomaleosaurus Hunting.png`  

Each diorama was crafted to visualize spatial layout, lighting, user position, and emotional intention.

### 🔹 Scene Sketches  
- `Scene 1_Museum Fossil Exhibit.png`  
- `Scene 2_Transformation to Living Creature.png`  
- `Scene 3_Predator in Action.png`  

These were annotated to highlight camera movement, user interactions, and transition effects.

## 🛠️ Additional Materials

- `Assignment_2_Storyboard.md` – Text explanation of scene logic and flow  
- `360 Sketching Template.pdf` – Used to simulate spherical field-of-view  
- `XR_MOOC_2_Assignment_2_Storyboard.pdf` – Full assignment submission with visuals and rationale

## 🌐 Reflections

This module made it clear that **physical prototyping still matters in immersive tech**. Despite the focus on digital tools, **paper, cardboard, and pen** offered rapid insight into:
- How users might feel when entering a scene  
- What spatial layout affects immersion or disorientation  
- Where the camera should be placed for maximum emotional impact  

It also strengthened my sense of **narrative sequencing** — using space and time to guide a user through an emotional and educational arc.

## 🔗 What Comes Next

Module 3 closes the analog design chapter. From here:
- **Module 4** digitizes these ideas through interface mockups and prototype demos  
- **Course 3** fully implements them using A-Frame, Unity, and WebAR platforms  

These sketches and dioramas became the blueprint for everything that followed. In the end, they weren’t just assignments — they were storyboards for a living sea dragon.
