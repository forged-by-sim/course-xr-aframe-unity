# 🧠 Module 2 – Design Critique & Concept Development  
**Course:** User Experience & Interaction Design for AR/VR/MR/XR  
**Specialization:** Extended Reality for Everybody (University of Michigan)  
**File:** `README_professional_summary_module2_course2.md`

## 📍 Overview

This module marked the conceptual birth of my XR project — the Rhomaleosaurus sea dragon experience. Drawing inspiration from **Google Arts & Culture’s 360° VR video** *“Bring the Rhomaleosaurus Sea Dragon Back to Life”*, I began analyzing immersive storytelling techniques and reimagining how static museum displays could be transformed into interactive learning environments.

The assignment focused on conducting a design critique of the original VR piece, identifying gaps in user agency, interaction, and educational depth, and then sketching out a more dynamic version that I could eventually prototype and build in later modules.

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze an existing immersive XR experience from a user-centered design perspective  
- Identify strengths and weaknesses in interaction flow, user comfort, and educational impact  
- Redesign a segment of the experience using sketches, annotated mockups, and interface layouts  
- Prepare conceptual groundwork for physical and digital prototyping in future modules

## 🐉 Inspiration: Rhomaleosaurus Sea Dragon

The original 360° video offered a visually striking but **passive** experience — the user could look around but had no control over pacing, learning depth, or interaction. My goal was to redesign this into a **gaze-triggered**, story-layered XR scene where the Rhomaleosaurus felt alive and the viewer’s presence mattered.

## 🧩 Design Explorations

### ✅ Interaction Redesign  
- Introduced **gaze-based interaction cues** to trigger scene transitions  
- Conceptualized a **“Bring to Life”** button that transforms a fossil into a swimming creature  
- Envisioned floating educational overlays tied to key anatomical features  

### ✅ Spatial Interface Mockups  
- Designed an alternate **VR interface** for navigating the experience  
- Proposed multiple camera positions for varying viewer perspectives (e.g., diver vs museum-goer)  
- Considered lighting, contrast, and comfort in the visual redesign

## 🖼️ Key Assets

- `Fossil Wall Display.png` – Mockup of the original static exhibit  
- `Swimming Rhomaleosaurus.png` – Concept visual of animated sea dragon  
- `Rhomaleosaurus VR Interface Redesign.png` – Interface sketch for interactive scene  
- `XR_MOOC_2_Assignment_1_Design_Critique.pdf` – Full design critique with rationale  

These visuals represented the **ideation phase** of the project — not yet buildable, but essential for setting the tone and direction of what would later become a functioning AR/VR/WebXR prototype.

## 🌊 Reflections

This module taught me that **designing for XR is as much about imagination and story as it is about tech**. It’s not enough to drop a 3D model into a scene — the interaction must feel purposeful, the transitions meaningful, and the user’s presence acknowledged.

It also reinforced the value of **building with intention**. Every visual sketch was guided by UX principles: clarity, comfort, curiosity.

## 🔗 What Comes Next

Module 2 served as the **ideation hub** of the Rhomaleosaurus project. In the next modules:

- **Module 3** expands these sketches into storyboards and physical dioramas  
- **Module 4** transitions the concepts into digital prototypes  
- **Course 3** brings the entire scene to life using A-Frame, Unity, and MyWebAR  

This README documents where it all began — from fossil to fantasy, from video inspiration to immersive interaction.
