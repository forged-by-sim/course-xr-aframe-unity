# 🧭 Module 1 – Foundations of the XR Design Process  
**Course:** User Experience & Interaction Design for AR/VR/MR/XR  
**Specialization:** Extended Reality for Everybody (University of Michigan)  
**File:** `README_professional_summary_module1_course2.md`

## 📍 Overview

This module introduced the **core principles of the XR design process**, with a focus on **human-centered design**, **interaction modalities**, and **prototyping mindsets** unique to immersive technology. While it was not project-based, the ideas introduced here became the conceptual backbone of everything I designed in Modules 2, 3, and 4.

It helped me reframe how I think about **presence, agency, and usability** in extended reality — especially as someone transitioning from simulation operations into XR development.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- The **XR Design Lifecycle**: research → ideation → prototyping → testing → iteration  
- Differences between **2D design thinking** and **spatial interaction design**  
- Types of XR input: hand tracking, gaze, controllers, environmental triggers  
- Balancing immersion with **usability, comfort, and cognitive load**  
- The importance of **affordances**, feedback, and environmental storytelling

## 🧰 Personal Takeaways

This module gave me the language and structure I needed to:
- Define how users would **enter**, **move through**, and **interact** with my scenes  
- Recognize that **comfort, not complexity**, drives immersion  
- Begin thinking in **narrative layers and transitions**, not just static moments  
- Stay grounded in **iterative, inclusive, and accessible design values**  

It’s also the module where I realized that my Rhomaleosaurus idea — inspired by Google Arts & Culture’s 360° video — needed to go beyond visual wow-factor and focus on **user agency**, **emotional flow**, and **educational storytelling**.

## 🛤️ How It Set the Stage

The XR design process outlined in this module shaped every creative and technical decision I made throughout Course 2:

- **Module 2**: I critiqued and reimagined an existing VR experience  
- **Module 3**: I sketched and built spatial storyboards and physical dioramas  
- **Module 4**: I created digital prototypes grounded in user comfort and presence

Even though Module 1 had no assignment deliverable, this README honors its role as the **starting compass** for the entire design journey.

📣 *Designing for XR isn't about impressing — it's about immersing. And that begins with understanding how users feel, move, and learn inside the world you're creating.*
