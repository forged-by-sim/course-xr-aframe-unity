# 💻 Module 4 – Digital Prototyping & Peer Review  
**Course:** User Experience & Interaction Design for AR/VR/MR/XR  
**Specialization:** Extended Reality for Everybody (University of Michigan)  
**File:** `README_professional_summary_module4_course2.md`

## 📍 Overview

This module marked the culmination of my XR user experience design process — translating all prior sketches, storyboards, and physical dioramas into **digital prototype mockups**. It was the final step before actual development began in Course 3.

Here, I created **scene visualizations** using digital drawing tools to simulate transitions, UI layout, and user viewpoint. I also participated in a structured **peer review**, where I gave and received design feedback, testing the clarity and emotional flow of my Rhomaleosaurus narrative.

## 🎯 Objective

- Translate previous analog prototypes into polished **digital prototypes**  
- Simulate XR interaction, camera flow, and UI transitions using flat images  
- Communicate emotional pacing and user immersion with design language  
- Receive and implement **peer feedback** to refine storytelling and usability

## 🌊 Prototype Narrative Structure

This digital phase refined three immersive scenes:

### 🖼️ Digital Scene 1 – Interact with Fossil in a Museum  
- Static introductory environment  
- The Rhomaleosaurus fossil is displayed on a wall  
- Hints of interactivity subtly encourage the user to look closer

### 🌀 Digital Scene 2 – Exploring the Deep  
- Triggered transformation into an underwater setting  
- The fossil animates and morphs into a living, swimming Rhomaleosaurus  
- Blue hues and distant lighting create a sense of scale and awe

### 🦈 Digital Scene 3 – Predator Encounter  
- The Rhomaleosaurus becomes active, hunting prey  
- The camera orbits the creature, showing motion trails and dynamic lighting  
- Designed to balance excitement and user comfort

## 🖼️ Visual Assets

- `Digital 1_Interact Museum with Rhomaleosaurus.png`  
- `Digital 2_Exploring the Deep_Rhomaleosaurus.png`  
- `Digital 3_Underwater Predator Encounter.png`  

Each image was layered with interaction flow, lighting, and user perspective in mind.

- `Storyboards_Physical_&_Digital_Prototypes.pdf` – Full prototype evolution, analog to digital  
- `XR_MOOC_2_Assignment_4_Digital_Prototype.pdf` – Final submission and rationale  
- `A5_Rhomaleosaurus_Peer Review.md` – Structured peer feedback and reflections

## 🔍 Peer Review Reflections

The peer review process was insightful. Reviewers highlighted:
- The effective emotional pacing from museum to ocean  
- The clarity of visual storytelling without text  
- The value of scene transitions in user orientation  

I refined the lighting in Digital Scene 2 and improved camera perspective in Scene 3 based on their suggestions.

## 🚀 What This Sets Up

This module completed the **pre-production phase** of my XR project. The prototypes from this module directly informed my:
- A-Frame scene design (Course 3, Module 1)  
- Unity prefab scene layout (Course 3, Module 2)  
- WebAR user placement logic (Course 3, Module 3)

Together, these images became the **blueprints** for immersive interaction, emotional beats, and visual storytelling.

## 🧠 Closing Thoughts

While not yet playable, these digital prototypes made the vision *feel real*. This is where **design met possibility** — and the Rhomaleosaurus truly began to swim.
