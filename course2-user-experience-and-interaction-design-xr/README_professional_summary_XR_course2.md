🧾 Course 2 – User Experience & Interaction Design for AR/VR/MR/XR
**Specialization:** Extended Reality for Everybody (University of Michigan)  
**Repository:** `course-user-experience-and-interaction-design-xr`

This course followed a clear arc: from early inspiration and interaction sketches, to spatial storyboarding, to physical and digital prototyping of immersive XR experiences. Each module built upon the last, culminating in a visual, narrative-rich exploration of what it means to design for presence, agency, and ethical impact in XR environments.

✅ Module 1 – Reflection-Only

This module introduced key theories of user experience (UX), interaction design, and human-centered thinking in immersive environments. While there were no major assignments, I used this module to orient my creative compass toward inclusivity, comfort, and intuitive design.

✅ Module 2 – Designing from Inspiration: Google’s Rhomaleosaurus

Summary:
In this module, I analyzed Google Arts & Culture’s “Bring the Rhomaleosaurus Sea Dragon Back to Life” project and used it as a springboard for my own XR design vision. Through sketches, interface redesigns, and concept critique, I explored the transformation of static fossil exhibits into dynamic, immersive storytelling tools.
This stage was conceptual — evaluating what worked in the original VR video, what could be improved for interactivity, and how to reimagine it through gaze-based controls, layered storytelling, and modern UX patterns.

✅ Module 3 – Storyboarding + Dioramas: Narrative Spatial Design

Assets used:

Diorama 1, 2, 3 PNGs

Scene 1–3 PNGs (Museum, Transformation, Predator)

360 Sketching Template.pdf

XR_MOOC_2_Assignment_2_Storyboard.pdf

Summary:
This module translated my earlier inspiration into a full 3-scene storyboard and diorama sequence, detailing how a viewer might experience the Rhomaleosaurus in an immersive educational environment.
Each scene was sketched to reflect different emotional beats: awe, transformation, and predator encounter. I experimented with how camera position, user perspective, and transitions could guide immersion. The dioramas were scanned and documented to show physical ideation of spatial interactions and XR narrative flow.

Summary:
The final module represented the digital transition of the storyboarding phase. I built mockups of what a user might see and feel during a museum-to-ocean transformation experience. These included interface refinements, depth layering, and camera movement simulations.
I also participated in a structured peer review, offering and receiving feedback on prototype fidelity, accessibility, and potential for immersive learning. This was a turning point — bringing the analog vision into digital form, ready for translation into Unity or A-Frame (as realized in Course 3).
