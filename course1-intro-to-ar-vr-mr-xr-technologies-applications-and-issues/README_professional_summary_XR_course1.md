# 🌐 Course 1 – Intro to AR/VR/MR/XR: Technologies, Applications & Issues  
**Specialization:** Extended Reality for Everybody (University of Michigan)  
**Repository:** `course-xr-intro-to-xr-technologies-applications-issues`

## 📍 Overview

This course laid the **conceptual and observational foundation** for understanding the XR ecosystem. It introduced key distinctions between **Augmented Reality (AR)**, **Virtual Reality (VR)**, and **Mixed Reality (MR)**, while exploring how they all fall under the broader umbrella of **Extended Reality (XR)**.

Through a series of visual critiques and real-world XR app explorations, I began developing a critical lens toward XR platforms, their use-cases, and their impact on society. This course shaped my trajectory as a simulation technologist, helping me identify ethical challenges, meaningful applications, and technical affordances across platforms.

Each module below includes a small but focused hands-on assignment — using apps like **Seek by iNaturalist** and **Complete Anatomy** to understand XR through direct observation.

## 🧾 Modules Summary

### ✅ Module 1 – XR App Classification & Interaction Analysis  
**Assignment Focus:**  
Observed and classified an existing XR application (Seek by iNaturalist), identifying whether it used AR, VR, MR, or XR features. Analyzed how the app engaged with the user’s environment, what technologies it relied on (camera, sensors, spatial input), and its educational impact.

- `SeekbyiNaturalist_Species Observation.png`  
- `XR_MOOC_1_Assignment_1_App_Classification.pdf`  
- `assignment1-honors.md`

### ✅ Module 2 – XR Technology Selection & Visualization  
**Assignment Focus:**  
Explored **Complete Anatomy**, an advanced 3D medical visualization app. Evaluated its user interaction model, use of spatial layering, and its strengths/limitations as a learning tool. Focused on the chest cavity, heart, and upper anatomical structures.

### ✅ Module 3 – Impact Analysis & Societal Considerations  
**Assignment Focus:**  
Analyzed the **societal, ethical, and cultural implications** of XR technologies using real-world observations. Captured natural and augmented content with Seek by iNaturalist and reflected on how XR could impact accessibility, privacy, and ecological education.

## 🧠 What This Course Contributed

Course 1 provided the **intellectual scaffolding** for all future projects:

- It helped me recognize **what makes XR valuable** — not just in form (AR/VR/MR), but in function (learning, storytelling, simulation).
- It sharpened my ability to analyze platforms and environments **through a user-centered, ethical lens**.
- And it gave me the foundation to imagine projects like the Rhomaleosaurus prototype — which would later emerge in Courses 2 and 3.
