# 🧭 Module 4 – XR Strategy & Ecosystem Thinking  
**Course:** Intro to AR/VR/MR/XR: Technologies, Applications & Issues  
**Specialization:** Extended Reality for Everybody (University of Michigan)  


## 📍 Overview  
This was a reflection-based module focused on the **strategic role of XR** in society, business, and education. While there was no formal assignment submission, I used this module to explore:

- Where XR is headed (WebXR, cloud rendering, spatial computing)  
- What XR developers must prioritize (accessibility, data transparency, inclusion)  
- How to think across platforms, from headset to mobile to browser

## 🧠 Reflections  
This module helped me **zoom out** and ask not just how XR works — but **why it should exist**, who it serves, and how we can build responsibly.

As someone transitioning from traditional simulation to immersive XR, this final module helped me anchor my ambitions in strategy and societal alignment.
