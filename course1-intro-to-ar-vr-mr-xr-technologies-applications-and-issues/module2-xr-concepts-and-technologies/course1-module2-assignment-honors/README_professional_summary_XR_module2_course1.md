# 🧠 Module 2 – XR Technology Exploration & Visualization  
**Course:** Intro to AR/VR/MR/XR: Technologies, Applications & Issues  
**Specialization:** Extended Reality for Everybody (University of Michigan)  


## 📍 Overview  
In this module, I explored **Complete Anatomy**, a powerful medical XR platform for human visualization. This application showcased how extended reality can be used in clinical training, medical simulation, and education.

I analyzed its strengths and limitations, focusing on spatial UI layout, depth layering, and educational fidelity. This was especially meaningful for me as a simulation technologist with experience in anatomy-based training environments.

## 🧠 Reflections  
This assignment confirmed my belief that XR can elevate simulation and training. The ability to zoom, peel back layers, and observe structural relationships mirrors the kind of **multi-layered realism** I aim to bring to future XR learning environments.
