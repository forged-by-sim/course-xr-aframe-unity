# 🌍 Module 3 – XR Impact Analysis & Societal Issues  
**Course:** Intro to AR/VR/MR/XR: Technologies, Applications & Issues  
**Specialization:** Extended Reality for Everybody (University of Michigan)  


## 📍 Overview  
This module focused on **ethical, cultural, and societal implications** of XR technologies. For the assignment, I returned to **Seek by iNaturalist** — not just to observe functionality, but to ask questions about inclusion, access, and the potential harms or biases XR might amplify.

I documented a live species observation and then conducted an impact analysis on the implications of data capture, accessibility, and environmental engagement in XR ecosystems.

## 💭 Reflections  
This module prompted me to think beyond features and into **consequences**. Who is this XR for? What does it collect? How does it support or exclude? It reminded me that XR must be designed not just for awe — but for equity.
