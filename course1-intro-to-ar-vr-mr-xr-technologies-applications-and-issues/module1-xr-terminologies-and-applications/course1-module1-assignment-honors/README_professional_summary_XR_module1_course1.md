# 🔍 Module 1 – XR App Classification & Interaction Analysis  
**Course:** Intro to AR/VR/MR/XR: Technologies, Applications & Issues  
**Specialization:** Extended Reality for Everybody (University of Michigan)  


## 📍 Overview  
This module introduced the fundamentals of XR — from terminology and classifications (AR, VR, MR, XR) to real-world applications and platforms.

For the assignment, I observed **Seek by iNaturalist**, a real-world mobile app, and evaluated how it leveraged AR to assist in species identification. I analyzed how the app interacted with the user’s environment and which sensory features it activated.

## 🌿 Reflections  
This app introduced me to how AR can blend education with exploration. XR doesn’t have to be spectacle — it can be quietly transformative, especially when layered into everyday tools like this.
