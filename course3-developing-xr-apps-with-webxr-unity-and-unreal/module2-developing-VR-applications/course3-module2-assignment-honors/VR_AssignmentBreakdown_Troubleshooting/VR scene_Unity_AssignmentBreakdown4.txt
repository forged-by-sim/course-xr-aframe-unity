🧠 Preparing and Importing a Rigged Dinosaur Model from Blender to Unity (for VR + AR Scenes)

This guide walks through the full process I used to prepare a rigged Rhomaleosaurus 3D model in Blender, export it as an .fbx file, and import it into Unity for use in both VR and AR scenes. The focus was on maintaining animation compatibility, preserving proper hierarchy, and ensuring prefab flexibility once inside Unity.

🦴 Step 1: Preparing the Rig in Blender

The original Rhomaleosaurus model was already rigged and parented correctly using Blender's Armature. However, I needed to ensure the model was ready for Unity export by reviewing several settings before exporting:

Switched to Object Mode

Selected Armature + Mesh using Shift + Click

Verified transforms were applied using Ctrl + A → Apply All Transforms

Opened the FBX export dialog via File > Export > FBX (.fbx)

From here, I configured the following options:

Export Settings:

Selected Objects: Checked

Object Types: Mesh + Armature (also included “Other” just in case)

Transform:

Scale: 1.00 (leaving it here instead of 1.03 for Unity compatibility)

Forward: -Z Forward

Up: Y Up

Apply Unit and Apply Transform: Checked

Geometry:

Apply Modifiers: Checked

Normals: "Normals Only"

Armature:

Primary Bone Axis: Y Axis

Secondary Bone Axis: X Axis

Armature FBX Node: Root

Only Deform Bones: Checked

Animation:

Key All Bones: Checked

NLA Strips: Checked

All Actions: Checked

I saved the file as:
Rhomaleo_Weighted_UNITY_FINAL_FIXED.fbx

This ensured my file would import with full hierarchy and be animation-ready.

🧱 Step 2: Importing the .fbx into Unity (with Proper Prefab Setup)

Inside Unity 6.2, I navigated to my Assets > Models_RHOMA > Rigged folder and dragged the .fbx file into the project panel. Unity generated a preview of the model and exposed the import settings under the Inspector panel.

Model Tab Settings:

Scale Factor: 1

Convert Units: Checked

Preserve Hierarchy: Checked

Optimize Mesh: Everything

Generate Colliders: Unchecked (not needed for visual prototype)

Import BlendShapes / Visibility / Cameras / Lights: Off (not needed)

Normals: Import

Weld Vertices: Off

Once satisfied, I right-clicked the .fbx file and selected:

Create > Prefab Variant

I named this new prefab variant:
Rhomaleo_Weighted_UNITY_FINAL_FIXED.prefab

This allows me to edit the prefab directly without touching the original .fbx import structure, keeping things clean.

🧩 Step 3: Adding the Prefab to the Scene

At first, Unity didn’t allow me to drag and drop the prefab into the scene directly.

Workaround:

I created an empty GameObject in the scene called Rhomaleo_Instance

Right-clicked the prefab in the Project panel → selected "Prefab > Replace With Prefab"

This replaced the placeholder object with the prefab content.

Once instantiated into the scene, the dinosaur appeared properly — fully visible, rigged, and ready for transformation.

🧭 Step 4: Adjusting Position and Verifying Visibility

I positioned the Rhomaleosaurus at:

Position: (0, 0, 0)

Rotation: (0, 0, 0)

Scale: (1, 1, 1)

Initially, setting the position to zero caused the dinosaur to disappear from the visible camera frustum. This was just a visibility issue — panning around revealed it was just off-screen. Once I moved the scene view camera and re-aligned the prefab with the environment floor, the model reappeared.

Key Tip: When repositioning prefabs, make sure to verify Scene view alignment — the model may be present, just not visible in your current view angle.

🧪 Step 5: Cross-Referencing with Original .glb Viewer

As a visual reference, I also opened the original rhomaleosaurus_high.glb file in a 3D viewer to see how the skeleton + textures appeared with animation and lighting. This was useful for:

Comparing smoothness of model movement

Spot-checking whether textures or materials needed adjusting

Planning for the animation pipeline in Unity later (e.g., idle vs swim cycle)

The goal is to replicate or approximate this visual experience in the final Unity AR scene — ideally triggered with tap interaction.

🔄 Step 6: Animation Consideration

At this stage, I didn’t yet configure Unity animations.

Question: Should I have exported Blender animation actions explicitly before import?

Yes. While the model was exported with animation strips checked (All Actions), Unity requires mapping animation clips in the Rig and Animation tabs after import. If these aren’t found automatically, Unity may need:

Manual animation import mapping

An Animator Controller setup

Keyframes set in Timeline or Animation window

That will be handled in the next phase (AR interactivity). The base rigging and prefab structure are now rock solid.

🥽 Outcome: VR Scene Complete, AR Scene Foundation Ready

By completing this prefab integration, I now have:

A working VR scene with a skeletal Rhomaleosaurus

A functioning rigged prefab variant compatible with Unity animation

The Unity Editor properly handling object transforms and hierarchy

My AR scene's major building blocks complete

Next steps include:

Adding AR Session Origin + AR Camera for AR Foundation

Configuring tap-to-place logic

Linking animations to user interactions

Time estimate for the final AR build:
2.5 to 4 hours depending on testing, platform deployment, and interaction depth.

💡 Lessons Learned

Blender’s FBX export is highly customizable — exporting only what's necessary avoids Unity import bloat

Unity’s prefab system is sensitive to hierarchy — use Prefab Variants for clean editing

Sometimes dragging a prefab into the scene fails — use "Replace With Prefab" as a workaround

Always double-check object visibility after transform resets

Planning your Blender rig and animation before export saves time in Unity.
