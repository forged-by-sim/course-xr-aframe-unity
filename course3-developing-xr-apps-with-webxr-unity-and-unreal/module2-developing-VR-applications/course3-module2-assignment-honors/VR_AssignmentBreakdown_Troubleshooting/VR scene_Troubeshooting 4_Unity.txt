🧯 Documenting Failed Attempts & Errors (Blender → Unity Rig Workflow)
⚠️ Early Rigging Roadblocks in Blender

The initial plan was to build a full skeleton (spine, neck, tail, limbs) using Blender's Armature system and parent it to the mesh with automatic weights. However, Blender on touchscreen + stylus input proved unreliable:

Clicking the bone tips (head/tail) to extrude would not register at all

Blender didn’t show blue dots or bone selection highlights as expected

Even with X-Ray mode and overlay settings enabled, the Armature could not be interacted with properly

Selecting the tip and pressing E to extrude did nothing visually

Using the extrude tool from the left toolbar didn’t respond to pen input

Eventually, Blender generated a second unconnected bone by accident, which led to additional cleanup

Ultimately, I handed off the rigging portion to Sol, since manual extrusion wasn't functional under my current Blender setup (touchscreen tablet + stylus + keyboard).

⚠️ The Bee Incident (File Preview Mismatch)

At one point, I clicked on what I believed was the exported .glb of the dinosaur in Windows 3D Viewer. The file failed to load and then previewed… a bee.

Turns out, the .glb either failed to export properly, or Windows 3D Viewer was loading a cached preview of a completely unrelated model (likely a default sample from earlier). This confirmed that I needed to not trust 3D Viewer previews blindly and instead verify imports inside Unity.

⚠️ Broken .fbx Import Attempts in Unity

Several FBX files were generated and tested. Most of them imported into Unity but failed in different ways:

The prefab showed no model in the scene

Console threw ImportFBX Errors

Armature showed up as “spaghetti bones” with no mesh

Some .fbx files only had bones with no mesh included at all

Others looked okay in the Project panel, but Unity didn’t allow dragging them into the scene

Even creating prefab variants from these FBX files still resulted in null references or blank GameObjects

In some cases, dragging the .fbx into the Hierarchy did nothing. In others, Unity allowed creating a variant but would crash or throw transform errors upon instantiation.

It became clear that although the Blender model looked complete, the exports were often broken due to:

Not applying transforms (Ctrl + A → Apply All Transforms)

Not selecting both the mesh and armature at export

Using inconsistent scale (e.g. 1.03 instead of 1.00)

In some exports, “Apply Modifiers” or “Apply Unit” was not checked

Sometimes Blender exported mesh without its vertex groups properly bound to bones, so the skin wouldn’t animate at all

⚠️ The “Can’t Drag Into Scene” Problem

Even after a proper .fbx export, Unity would not allow dragging the prefab into the scene.

After checking:

Prefab preview was valid

Prefab expanded to show mesh and bones

Materials appeared under the Renderer

But Unity still silently refused to allow dragging.

This was resolved by:

Creating an Empty GameObject in the scene

Right-clicking that empty object and choosing Prefab > Replace With Prefab

Selecting the working .fbx variant

Unity replaced the empty with the prefab content — and it finally appeared

This workaround solved the dragging issue, but it was a surprising Unity behavior that wasn’t well-documented in official docs.

⚠️ Disappearing Prefab at (0,0,0)

After placement, setting the dino prefab's position to (0, 0, 0) made it appear to "disappear."

This wasn't actually a bug — the prefab moved to the origin, but my camera and scene view were centered elsewhere. Once I pressed F to focus the Scene view on the selected prefab, the model reappeared, centered and scaled correctly.

Lesson: a prefab being “invisible” doesn’t always mean it's broken. It might just be out of view.

⚠️ Rhomaleo_Weighted_UNITY_FINAL(static).fbx = Armature Only

At one point, Unity imported a static .fbx version which showed bones but no mesh.

It turned out the static file had:

Correct scale (1.00)

No mesh — only the armature

This was likely exported with only the Armature selected and no mesh object, which made it useless for visual placement or animation.

✅ What Finally Worked

After repeated attempts and checklist refinement, the final .fbx was exported using:

Both Mesh and Armature selected

Scale set to 1.00

Transforms applied

Export settings matching Unity’s coordinate system (-Z Forward, Y Up)

“Apply Unit” and “Apply Transform” checked

“Apply Modifiers” checked

All animation boxes checked (even if no animation was embedded yet)

Once imported into Unity, the prefab:

Showed correct structure and materials

Could be opened directly via “Open Prefab” view

Could be added to the scene using “Replace With Prefab”

Was positioned cleanly at (0,0,0) with scale (1,1,1)

💡 Why These Failures Are Valuable

Every mistake helped clarify:

How strict Unity is about scale, transform, and hierarchy during .fbx import

How Blender’s export settings directly impact rig and prefab behavior

How broken drag behavior in Unity is sometimes solved with prefab replacement

How relying on 3D viewers outside Unity can give false confirmations

All of this made me more aware of Blender’s export structure, Unity’s prefab workflow, and how to prep models for VR and AR projects in the future.
