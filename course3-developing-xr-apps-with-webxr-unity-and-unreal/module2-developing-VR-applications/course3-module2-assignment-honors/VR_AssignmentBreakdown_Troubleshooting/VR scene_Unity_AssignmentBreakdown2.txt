🦕 Animating and Recording the Rhomaleosaurus in Unity

🧠 Objective

To bring the Rhomaleosaurus model to life inside Unity using a rigged and animated .fbx file, ensuring the model performs a “swimming” animation, is properly oriented in the scene, and is recorded for portfolio presentation.

🛠️ Tools Used

Unity 6.2

Blender (for rigging)

Mixamo (for animation)

Unity Animator Controller

Unity Recorder (for capturing the in-editor playthrough)

🪢 Step-by-Step Setup Process
1. Importing the Animated .FBX File

I started by dragging the rigged and animated file Rhomaleo_Animated_EXPORT_FINAL.fbx into my Unity project folder under:
Assets/Models_RHOMA/Rigged/

This file already contained the armature, mesh, and the animation clip (SwimmingBiting), which had been exported from Blender after a Mixamo animation was retargeted to the skeleton.

2. Dragging into Scene & Organizing the Hierarchy

I initially created an empty GameObject and used the "Replace Prefab" method to insert the prefab into the scene. However, I ended up with two dinosaurs in the hierarchy: one with animation and one without. To fix this, I deleted the non-animated version and kept only:

Rhomaleo_Animated_EXPORT_FINAL

Positioned the prefab at:

Y = 0.2

Z = -4

Rotation Y = 180
This made the dinosaur face the camera and float nicely within view.

3. Setting Up the Animator

I created a new Animator Controller called Rhomaleo_Animator under Assets/Materials_RHOMA/. Then:

Added a new animation state and dragged in the SwimmingBiting animation clip.

Connected Entry → SwimmingBiting to auto-play when the scene starts.

Applied this Animator Controller to the dinosaur prefab by selecting it in the Hierarchy and assigning the controller in the Inspector.

Dragged the generated Rhomaleo_Animated_EXPORT_FINALAvatar into the Avatar field on the Animator component.

At this point, all animation logic was wired up, but the dinosaur still wasn’t swimming yet.

4. Why It Wasn’t Swimming at First (Troubleshooting)

Even though the clip and controller were set up correctly, nothing happened during play mode. Here's what we checked and fixed:

The Avatar wasn’t assigned in the Animator component initially.

Under Rig tab in the model’s Import Settings, I made sure:

Animation Type = Generic

Avatar Definition = "Create From This Model"

Clicked Apply

After that, I went back to the Animator component on the prefab in the scene and dragged in the .Avatar file generated by Unity (Rhomaleo_Animated_EXPORT_FINALAvatar). The animation finally played successfully after this fix.

5. Final Adjustments for the Scene

Rotated the prefab using Y = 180 to face the correct direction.

Positioned the prefab slightly up (Y = 0.2) and back (Z = -4) so it floated in the scene comfortably.

Saved the scene before pressing Play to prevent data loss.

Upon hitting Play, the Rhomaleosaurus came to life—swimming in place smoothly!

🎨 Optional: Coloring the Model

Although the animation was functional, the model appeared stark white, unlike the glTF version shown in 3D Viewer. I debated whether to assign realistic materials and textures, but since the main goal was functionality and animation, I opted to keep the pale model to focus on motion for now. This could be a great next step in future iterations.

🎥 Unity Recorder: Capturing the Animation
1. Installing Unity Recorder

Opened Window → Package Manager

Searched for "Recorder" under Unity Registry

Installed Recorder 5.1.3

After restarting Unity (important!), Recorder showed up under:

Window → General → Recorder → Recorder Window

2. Recording Setup Configuration

Inside the Recorder Window:

Recording Mode: Manual

Source: Game View

Output Resolution: 1920 × 1080 (Full HD)

Encoder: Unity Media Encoder

Format: H.264 MP4

Encoding Quality: High

Include Audio: Checked (optional)

Output Path:
C:\Simulation_Projects\GitHub\Setup Guide In-Editor Tutorial\Recordings\Movie_001.mp4

This ensured a clean, high-quality MP4 was saved to a designated project subfolder for GitHub uploads and presentations.

3. Recording the Final Animation

Pressed Play in Unity

Pressed Start Recording in the Recorder

Let the animation loop for a few seconds

Pressed Stop Recording, then exited Play Mode

The MP4 file was automatically saved to the folder path specified, ready to be added to my portfolio or submitted with my XR2 honors assignment.

🧩 Lessons Learned and Pro Tips

Saving Before Playing: Unity doesn’t auto-save changes made to prefabs or scene settings when entering Play Mode. Always hit Ctrl+S or File → Save.

Avatar Setup Matters: Even if the Animator and animation clip are correct, the prefab needs a valid avatar created from the rig, or the animation won’t play.

Unity Recorder Requires Restart: If Recorder doesn’t show up after installing, restart Unity. This often fixes the menu visibility issue.

Two Dinosaurs in Scene: Watch for duplicate prefabs when using “Replace Prefab” vs direct dragging. Always check the hierarchy panel.

Transform Positioning: Set positions before entering Play Mode to prevent losing manual changes.

🗂️ Files Used

✅ Outcome

The animated Rhomaleosaurus now swims smoothly in Unity and is recorded as a Full HD video for presentation. This project demonstrates end-to-end animation integration, Animator Controller logic, model rigging import, and Unity Recorder capture—suitable for XR assignments, portfolios, and technical interviews.
