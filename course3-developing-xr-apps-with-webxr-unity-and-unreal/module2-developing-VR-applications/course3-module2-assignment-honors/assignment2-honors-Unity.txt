Summary of Key Interactions & Reflection
Key Interactions

The core interaction of this scene is immersive observation from a fixed camera rig positioned in front of a swimming Rhomaleosaurus. This passive experience highlights motion, scale, and environmental realism, simulating the sensation of watching a prehistoric creature glide through water.

While no explicit user-triggered interactions (such as teleportation or object manipulation) are implemented in this iteration, the scene is designed to support future enhancements like gaze-based toggles, environment facts, or navigation menus. The camera angle and movement were carefully adjusted to create a natural first-person viewing position that feels anchored in the environment.

Reflection

This VR scene evolved from a simple WebXR prototype built in A-Frame (Assignment 1) into a more dynamic Unity experience. Working in Unity allowed me to animate the Rhomaleosaurus, integrate underwater lighting, and fine-tune the motion loop for a natural swim cycle.

The hardest part was coordinating Blender rigging and Unity prefab creation. I had to manually weight-paint the dinosaur model and troubleshoot bone structures to ensure the animation exported cleanly. Once the model was working, the Unity Recorder setup also required adjustment, especially when toggling with the play mode feature and ensuring camera positioning carried over correctly between sessions.

This assignment helped me understand the importance of camera placement, lighting, and scene layering (foreground/midground/background) in crafting believable VR environments.

Questions / Feedback Request

Are there best practices for keeping animation file sizes low without sacrificing smoothness, especially for mobile VR?

If I wanted to add object manipulation in future iterations (e.g., letting the user “poke” or rotate Rhomaleo), what Unity components or XR plugins should I explore first?

Do you recommend setting up travel via teleportation before or after adding interaction UIs like toggle menus?

I’d love any feedback on realism, animation smoothness, or what interaction to prioritize next. This is still a work in progress, but I’m proud of how far it’s come!
