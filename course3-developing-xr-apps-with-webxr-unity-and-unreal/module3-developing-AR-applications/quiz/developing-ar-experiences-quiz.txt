1. Which of the following statements are correct about AR displays? Choose all that apply.

==> Head-worn AR means using a form of glasses to see the AR world directly and always
==> Marker-less AR means using the AR device as a lens into the AR world
==> Marker-based AR means using a fiducial marker as a portal into the AR world
==> Monitor-based AR means using a monitor as a mirror into the AR world


2. Which of the following statements are correct about marker-less AR systems as far as environmental understanding is concerned? Choose all that apply.

==> They implement scene understanding to provide classification labels for recognized environmental features such as walls and windows
==> They implement plane detection to provide the location and size of detected surfaces
==> They implement spatial mapping to provide a point cloud for depth sensing and occlusion rendering


3. Which of the following are key design issues when creating AR applications? Choose all that apply.

==> Navigating social and ethical concerns when collecting and processing data about the user’s surroundings.
==> Making the virtual content accessible to users with special needs.
==> Adapting the interactions to a broad range of AR devices including less powerful devices.


4. How would you explain how marker-based tracking works at a technical level? Choose one (1). 

==> The system analyzes each camera frame to segment out the marker and identify key components that allow it to estimate the pose.


5. What are potential benefits of using marker-based as opposed to marker-less AR? Choose all that apply.

==> Marker-based AR provides a simple way to support co-located experiences around a shared marker.
==> Marker-based AR can be used for rapid prototyping by simulating interactions using markers.
==> Marker-based AR is compatible with less powerful, low-end devices.
==> Marker-based AR can be used to simulate detecting objects and people in the environment.


6. What are two (2) advantages of using marker-less AR compared to marker-based AR?

==> The user is free to move around at room or world scale.
==> There is no need for instrumentation of the user or environment.


7. Which of these are key design considerations when adapting VR scenes to smartphone-based AR? Choose all that apply.

==> Position and size of virtual objects and how they fit into and blend with the user’s environment
==> Whether AR users will be able to see the main virtual objects or whether the spatial layout needs to be adapted to fit the smaller field of view
==> Whether the AR experience should be tabletop, room, or world scale
==> How controller- or hand-based interactions should be adapted for touch and speech input


8. What are key design differences between hand-held and head-worn AR experiences? Choose all that apply.

==> Physical size of hand-held AR displays varies more than the field of view of head-worn AR displays
==> Tracking capabilities of head-worn AR displays are usually more advanced


9. What tips and tricks would you give someone designing marker-based AR applications? Choose all that apply.

==> Marker size determines the scale of the AR experience.
==> Smaller markers are harder to detect and track continuously.


10. What tips and tricks would you give someone designing marker-less AR applications? Choose all that apply.


==> Provide a matching visual preview before placing the AR content in the environment.
==> Incorporate light and shadow into the AR scene to better blend with the environment in the absence of light estimation.
