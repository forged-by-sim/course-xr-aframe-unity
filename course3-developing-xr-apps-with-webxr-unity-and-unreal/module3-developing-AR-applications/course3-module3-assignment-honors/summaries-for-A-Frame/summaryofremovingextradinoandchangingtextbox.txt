Here’s a detailed summary of our conversation, step by step, highlighting the evolution of my project and the solutions I've explored:

1. Initial Problem

I had an HTML page using A-Frame to display a 3D model of a Rhomaleosaurus.

There were two dinosaurs: a static one in front and an orbitable one in the back.

I wanted to remove the front static dinosaur while keeping the interactive 3D viewer.

2. Removing the front static dinosaur

I identified that the front dinosaur was represented by an <a-entity> in your HTML containing the GLTF model.

The initial suggestion was to remove or comment out the <a-entity> that had the front dinosaur.

I've clarified that this didn’t fully work because of how my code was structured.

Eventually, I focused on removing only the front model entity and leaving the orbitable model intact.

3. Working with the info panel

I wanted to keep the black info panel and the text for the dinosaur, but remove the front dinosaur.

Discussion points included:

How the panel is linked to the dinosaur model via panel-scale component.

How to position the panel so it’s visible without being blocked by the model.

I suggested creating an independent <a-entity> for the info panel so it could exist without the front dinosaur.

4. Adjusting panel size and position

I started adjusting the panel’s size and location:

width and height for the <a-plane> set the size of the panel.

position attribute moved the panel to the side, away from the dinosaur.

I thought about keeping the text large and positioning it within the panel for readability.

5. Adjusting text size

I wanted bigger text for the panel.

The width attribute on <a-text> controls the text’s maximum layout width.

The scale attribute on <a-text> controls the actual letter size.

Both width and scale can be adjusted for bigger, well-centered text.

Multiline text needs careful adjustment of both width and position to remain visually aligned.

6. Setting the scene background to black

I tried setting background="color: black" on <a-scene> but the background still appeared gray.

Reason: my background-gradient.js script was overriding the background.

The solution: add an <a-sky color="#000000"></a-sky> entity inside <a-scene> to guarantee a fully black background.

7. Final panel adjustments

I had a large info panel with multiline text positioned off to the side of the dinosaur.

Panel attributes:

<a-plane> for the black panel (color="#000000", opacity="0.6").

<a-text> for content with adjustable width and scale.

Panel position set using position="2 2 -2" (or similar) to ensure it’s visible and away from the dinosaur.

8. Key Takeaways / Learnings

Removing entities in A-Frame: Delete or comment out <a-entity> blocks corresponding to the objects you want gone.

Text in A-Frame:

width → text box width (wraps lines).

scale → actual text size (makes letters bigger).

position → centers the text on the panel.

Panel positioning: Keep the panel separate from the model if you want it in open space.

Background color: <a-sky color="#000000"> overrides any scripts or defaults, ensuring full black background.

Orbitable model: Keep only one <a-entity> with the GLTF model and animation-mixer to allow interaction.

9. Outcome

I've successfully:

Removed the front static dinosaur.

Kept the orbitable dinosaur in the background.

Created a black info panel with large text.

Positioned the panel to the side, away from the model.

Set the background of the scene fully black using <a-sky>.
