Why it’s sufficient for AR/VR

3D model with animation – The dino moves naturally.

Orbitable camera – Users can view it from all sides, above, and below.

Dynamic info panel – Provides context and labels, always facing the user.

Lighting and shadows – Makes the model look realistic.

AR/VR compatibility – Since I'm using model-viewer.js and A-Frame’s XR features, I can add an AR mode easily later.

Optional Enhancements

I could add more features for a truly polished AR experience, like:

Multiple info panels for different body parts.

Interactive tooltips or clickable info.

Scale & placement in real-world AR using ar-hit-test or ar.js.

Sound effects or narration when users approach the model.

It’s been a fun journey turning my Rhomaleosaurus into a fully interactive, polished AR-ready scene.
