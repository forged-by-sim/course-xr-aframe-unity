Here are a few quick visual polish tips that will make the scene feel much more “museum-quality”:

1. Background gradient / sky

Right now you have the default scene background. You can make it more cinematic:

<a-sky color="#a0e0ff"></a-sky>


Or use a gradient via the background-gradient.js you already included. A soft gradient makes your dino pop and avoids that “floating in nothing” look.

2. Ground / shadow improvements

Add a subtle texture to the ground plane instead of plain gray: marble, sand, or dirt textures.

Make the shadow slightly softer or bigger to give your model weight and presence.

<a-plane rotation="-90 0 0" width="10" height="10" material="color: #ccc; roughness: 1" shadow></a-plane>

3. Lighting tweaks

Add a rim light behind the dino to outline it nicely:

<a-light type="spot" position="-5 5 -5" intensity="0.3" angle="60" penumbra="0.5" castShadow="true"></a-light>


Slightly reduce the ambient light and let directional lights create subtle depth. This adds realism.

4. Panel polish

Add rounded edges and a slight glow to the info panel using shader: flat with opacity + border texture or a semi-transparent PNG.

Slightly animate the panel to “float” up and down to catch attention:

<a-animation attribute="position" dur="3000" direction="alternate" repeat="indefinite" to="1.5 1.85 0"></a-animation>

5. Camera tweaks

Enable damping / smooth orbit in model-viewer.js so rotating around the dino feels fluid.

Slight zoom limits prevent the camera from clipping into the model.

All of these are minor tweaks that visually elevate your scene without touching the core interactivity or AR features.
