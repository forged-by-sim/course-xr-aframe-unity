🧪 Failed Attempts: Unity Animation Binding Errors & Troubleshooting (Transparency Log)
This section documents all the unsuccessful efforts to make the Rhomaleosaurus swim within Unity using exported Blender files. It explains what was tried, what didn’t work, and why the final solution pivoted back to A‑Frame. These insights are useful for recruiters, teammates, and anyone trying to troubleshoot similar Unity animation pipeline issues.

Problem Summary
Despite numerous rebuilds, the Dino animation in Unity stopped working after the initial success. The Animator showed the state as playing, but the model did not move. This was confirmed to be a binding issue, where the animation clip was no longer affecting the armature bones.

Failed Attempt 1: Clean FBX Export Without Parenting


Exported the Dino from Blender using Ctrl+A to apply all transforms.


Did not parent the mesh to the armature with Ctrl+P (automatic weights).


Imported to Unity → Animation state was active, but no movement occurred.


Conclusion: Missing parent-bone relationships prevented the animation from binding to the model.



Failed Attempt 2: Manual Cleanup in Unity


Imported FBX with extra objects (camera, lights, cube).


Attempted to delete these directly in Unity’s hierarchy.


Prefab unpacked → created missing object references.


Even after cleaning and re-exporting, the model remained static in animation.



Failed Attempt 3: Recreating Animator Controller


Created a fresh Animator Controller.


Assigned a swimming-biting animation clip.


Enabled "Loop Time" in the Import Settings.


Connected clip to the Animator → Still no movement.


Played scene: Animator showed active state, but bones did not move.



Failed Attempt 4: “Apply” in Animation Tab Did Not Fix Binding


Verified "Apply" was pressed after enabling "Import Animation" and "Loop Time".


Still resulted in no motion.


Even after assigning Root Node (Armature) in Rig tab, the model didn’t move.


Tried various import configurations: Legacy, Generic, Humanoid — same result.



Failed Attempt 5: Unity Version Switch


Installed Unity 2022.3 LTS thinking it would be more stable.


Reopened project and reimported all FBX and prefab files.


Set up new Animator and animation clips.


No visual difference → Still static model.


Clip count randomly dropped from 1 to 0 after import in some cases.



Failed Attempt 6: Using MP4 Video as a Fallback


Considered exporting a video of the Dino swimming in Unity and importing that into the scene.


Realized this approach wouldn’t support interactivity, 3D depth, or AR integration.


Dropped the idea to preserve XR goals.



Failed Attempt 7: Rebuilding from Scratch


Deleted all previous FBX, prefabs, controllers, and metadata files.


Re-exported from Blender with:


Ctrl+A (Apply Transforms)


Ctrl+P (Parent with Automatic Weights)


Armature and mesh renamed cleanly.


Exported with animations baked (All Actions, NLA Strips, Force Start/End).




Imported into Unity → Dino visible, camera adjusted, animation state playing… still static.



Final Theory (Post-Mortem Reflection)


It’s possible the binding broke when the original working controller was deleted.


Another hypothesis: Unity sometimes fails to properly rebind clips when:


Model names or bone names change


Prefab is replaced without reconnecting controller paths


Project metadata becomes corrupted between versions




There may have been something uniquely correct about the original export and import chain that wasn't easily reproducible.



Why We Pivoted to A‑Frame
After extensive rebuilding attempts, A‑Frame proved to be:


Consistent — The Dino animated correctly on every load.


Simple — Animation playback worked immediately using animation-mixer.


Lightweight — No need to rebuild rigs or prefab hierarchies.


Web-ready — Ideal for portfolio showcasing, VR viewer deployment, and future AR work.



What This Experience Taught Me


When Unity’s animation pipeline breaks, it can become deeply embedded and hard to reverse without starting fresh.


Always save working prefabs and animator controllers as backups — especially if the model is animating correctly.


WebXR tools like A‑Frame are extremely useful for fallback visualization and prototype delivery.


Sometimes, moving forward means changing platforms, not just fixing code.
