🦖 Rhomaleosaurus AR Scene: WebXR Honors Project Tutorial

This tutorial summarizes the full development journey of the Rhomaleosaurus AR experience built for the XR Course 3 Honors Assignment. The project began as a 3D model viewer using A-Frame and evolved into a functional marker-less WebAR scene accessible via mobile browsers. This document outlines the steps taken, platforms tested, technical pivots, setbacks, and solutions that led to a successful cross-platform XR deployment.

🎯 Project Goal

The goal was to create a lightweight XR experience where users could view a scientifically inspired Rhomaleosaurus — first as a 3D VR-style viewer and then as an AR model placed in real-world environments using a smartphone or tablet.

🛠 Stage 1 – Rigging and Model Preparation

The project began with the raw .glb model of the Rhomaleosaurus, which was rigged and animated manually in Blender. The armature consisted of bones mapped to the flippers and body to simulate swimming. The animation was exported alongside the geometry using Blender’s GLTF/GLB exporter, ensuring WebXR compatibility.

Early Unity exports were attempted, but issues with animation playback and WebXR deployment on mobile led to pivoting toward a browser-first solution.

🌐 Stage 2 – A-Frame WebXR Viewer

An A-Frame viewer (index5.html) was developed as a VR-style experience that allowed users to orbit around the animated model. The scene used A-Frame’s <a-gltf-model> to load the model, combined with animation-mixer to play the swimming loop. Custom lighting, a black-to-gray gradient background, and a floating info panel made the experience feel like a museum installation.

The A-Frame viewer included a working desktop and mobile version and was later screen-recorded using Windows Game Bar to capture orbiting behavior and animation for submission and portfolio purposes.

🧪 Stage 3 – AR Scene Exploration

The transition to AR introduced multiple new challenges. First, attempts were made to activate A-Frame’s webxr="optionalFeatures: hit-test" for marker-less AR. However, local server hosting on a Surface Pro caused firewall issues that prevented the mobile phone from reaching the computer’s IP. Multiple attempts using Python’s http.server were made, but required the command window to remain open and firewall exceptions to be allowed.

After resolving the network connection, the phone successfully loaded the scene — but Safari did not display the AR cube icon because the model was in .glb format, and iOS requires .usdz for native AR.

Attempts to convert .glb to .usdz using online tools and Blender’s exporter didn’t work reliably on the iPhone. This led to a platform pivot.

🚀 Stage 4 – Final Deployment via MyWebAR

The final version of the AR scene was created using MyWebAR.com, a no-code browser-based WebAR builder that supports marker-less AR on both Android and iOS devices.

The animated .glb model was uploaded and placed in a marker-less WebAR project. Animation was preserved and looped successfully. The AR scene could then be accessed through:

A direct mobile link to the hosted scene

A QR code that opens the AR viewer

An iframe embed code that allows the scene to be included on any website

Multiple successful screenshots were taken from an iPhone to demonstrate the working AR scene with the animated model placed in real space.

A video titled AR Scene_Rhomaleosaurus Swims.mp4 was recorded using the iPhone's built-in screen recorder, showing the model floating and animating in AR.

🎬 Media Captured

Two polished videos were recorded:

Rhomaleosaurus Viewer - A-Frame.mp4: the WebXR orbit viewer version

AR Scene_Rhomaleosaurus Swims.mp4: the final MyWebAR deployment in real space

These videos were saved for documentation, submission, and portfolio showcasing. Screenshots of the AR placement, QR code, and final scene were also archived.

✍️ Course Submission Components

The following written sections were prepared and submitted for XR Course 3 – Honors Assignment 3:

Design Idea & Sketch
The concept was inspired by natural history exhibits, aiming to recreate a prehistoric sea creature and place it in both VR and AR. The AR version allowed real-time placement without markers, offering an immersive and educational experience.

Development Approach and Tools
Blender was used for modeling and animation. Unity was attempted for AR but proved unreliable for mobile. A-Frame was used for the WebXR viewer, and MyWebAR hosted the final marker-less AR version. The workflow included rigging, exporting to .glb, testing AR on multiple devices, and recording.

Envisioned AR/VR User Experience
The intended experience was for users to view the animated creature either in a virtual museum-like viewer or placed into their physical space via mobile camera. No UI was used — instead, interaction occurred through physical movement around the model.

Summary of Key Interactions & Reflection
Key interaction was marker-less AR exploration. Reflection focused on toolchain pivots, firewall troubleshooting, WebAR hosting, and achieving presence through animation. A major insight was the power of pivoting tools without losing the core user experience.

Open Issues and Feedback Questions
Remaining questions included how to compress .glb models for WebAR and whether object interactions (e.g., tap to rotate) could be added easily. Peer feedback was welcomed on best practices for real-time AR model optimization and multi-platform deployment.

🎯 Final Result

The final project consists of:

A working WebXR VR viewer (desktop + mobile)

A live WebAR scene hosted via MyWebAR

Two recorded videos documenting both versions

Full reflection, process notes, and platform experimentation

GitHub repository with assets, scene files, videos, and readme

💡 Notes for Future Developers

Use A-Frame for accessible 3D scene building and lightweight animation.

Use MyWebAR (or similar platforms like 8thWall or echo3D) to deploy marker-less AR when native WebXR support is inconsistent.

Record both VR and AR demos for maximum impact in portfolios or submissions.

Don’t be afraid to pivot platforms if animation, hosting, or rendering breaks — XR is all about adapting to the medium.
