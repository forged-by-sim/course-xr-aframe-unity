🦖 Rigging and Animating the Rhomaleosaurus in Blender and Unity

By Noemi | GitHub: [forged-by-sim]

📘 Overview

This tutorial documents the full workflow of importing, rigging, animating, exporting, and troubleshooting a complex dinosaur model (Rhomaleosaurus) for use in Unity. The goal was to create a functional animated asset for an AR scene using Unity and A-Frame/WebXR. The project included Blender rigging, weight painting, Unity import, prefab setup, and runtime animation testing — all under the constraint of using a keyboard and tablet without a mouse.

The intention behind this write-up is transparency: to capture the full process, including failures, decision-making, and lessons learned.

🧱 Initial Setup in Blender
Scene Content

The Rhomaleosaurus model was composed of several distinct mesh objects:

Object_7 (the main dinosaur body)

Object_9 (tongue)

Eyes

Upper Teeth

Lower Jaw

PolySurface

Misc. tetrahedral and triangle-shaped icons (used to differentiate grouped vs. ungrouped mesh)

Objective

Combine all necessary parts into one unified mesh, bind the result to the existing armature, and export it as a clean .fbx file that would animate properly in Unity.

🧰 Pre-Rigging Cleanup and Mesh Evaluation

Began by inspecting the Outliner and toggling visibility to identify which items actually contributed to the visible mesh.

Triangular icons represented visible mesh geometry; tetrahedral icons were usually empty objects or unused nodes.

Verified which objects glowed (highlighted in the 3D viewport) when selected. If nothing highlighted, the object was unused or empty and could be hidden or deleted.

🔗 Merging Mesh Components

Pressed A to select all geometry in Object Mode.

Used Ctrl + J to join all visible, necessary mesh parts (e.g., body, teeth, tongue, eyes) into one object.

Verified the merge was successful by entering Edit Mode and selecting various vertices with the L key to ensure they were part of a unified object.

Hidden or disconnected components (e.g., triangle shapes with no geometry) were ignored or deleted for clarity.

🦴 Parenting to the Armature

Switched to Object Mode and selected the unified mesh first.

Shift-clicked the Armature object (which held all the bones).

Used Object → Parent → With Automatic Weights to bind the mesh to the skeleton.

Confirmed binding by entering Pose Mode and pressing R on bones to test movement.

Observed: the body moved, but eyes and teeth did not follow, despite being joined.

🎯 Diagnosing Binding Issues

Entered Weight Paint Mode and found that parts of the mesh (e.g., eyes, teeth) did not receive proper vertex weights.

Explored Vertex Groups under Object Data Properties → confirmed that joints existed (joint1–joint50), but certain geometry had no weight influence.

Tried Merge by Distance and Transfer Weights, but these didn't resolve the parenting issue for eyes/teeth.

🎭 Alternative Parenting Approaches (Not Fully Successful)

Experimented with selecting individual objects like Eyes, shift-clicking bones, and using Parent → To Bone.

While this made some components follow the armature in hierarchy, animation playback still did not animate the components correctly in Unity.

🧹 Unity Project Cleanup

Deleted old prefabs and .fbx files from the Unity Models_RHOMA folder, including the Rigged subfolder and backups.

Retained only two folders: Legacy (with original .glb) and an empty Rigged folder for fresh imports.

Re-exported the .fbx from Blender using correct settings:

Smoothing: Face

Armature FBX: Root

Applied transforms (Ctrl + A) before exporting

Named export: Rhomaleo_FINAL_Export.fbx

🧪 Import to Unity and Animator Setup

Imported the .fbx into Unity’s Rigged folder.

Created a prefab variant by right-clicking and selecting Create > Prefab Variant.

Created an empty GameObject in the Hierarchy and replaced it with the new prefab.

Connected the animator controller (Rhomaleo_Animator) and verified that the correct animation (swimming and biting) was linked.

However, no animation occurred during Play Mode.

🔍 Animation Debugging in Unity

Confirmed the Animator was assigned and looping.

The avatar appeared assigned and valid, but the mesh did not animate.

Explored reasons:

Missing SkinnedMeshRenderer under Armature

Animation controller might be disconnected from the root bone

No motion in Scene view or Game view

Repeated deletion and reimport of .fbx files, recreated prefab variants, and ensured everything was freshly linked. Still no movement.

🧠 Blender Review & Rebuild

Relaunched the earlier Untitled2.blend file which had proper animation working before.

Parent was reapplied (Ctrl + P → With Automatic Weights) after joining all objects.

Entered Pose Mode and tested movement: the body animated, but eyes and teeth still did not follow.

Entered Weight Paint Mode and verified again: eyes and teeth had no influence from any joints.

🩺 Last-Ditch Repair Strategy (Half Successful)

Joined Eyes, Teeth, and Tongue with Object 7 (main body).

Entered Pose Mode again.

Body animated correctly.

Eyes and teeth remained detached visually but were now technically part of the mesh.

This produced a "Frankenstein" result: animation existed, but the geometry appeared disjointed. The idea to hide or delete the teeth/eyes entirely was raised as a backup plan if no clean solution emerged.

📉 Failed Experiments (Worth Documenting)

Parenting individual meshes after binding failed due to missing weight influence.

Binding to individual bones (e.g., parenting Eyes to joint14) did not result in Unity-visible movement.

Transferring weights via Blender’s Data Transfer modifier produced inconsistent results.

Trying to clean up Unity’s prefab system by moving backup folders sometimes caused missing references.

Unity errors like "Missing Prefab GUID" were persistent but harmless.

Animations visible in Blender didn’t transfer unless exported .fbx had animation checked and contained a valid root bone.

✅ Lessons Learned

Weight painting is crucial — all visible geometry must be influenced by bones to animate.

Joining objects is not enough — verify that they have vertex groups and weights assigned.

Unity only plays what’s rigged and skinned — any geometry not linked via SkinnedMeshRenderer will be static.

Keep old .blend files and .fbx exports — they act as rollback points.

When stuck, rebuild the Unity hierarchy from scratch and reassign the Animator Controller, Avatar, and Animation Clip.

🧠 Reflections

This project was not just a technical exercise — it was a persistence challenge. Animating a dinosaur with disconnected geometry while working mouse-free forced creative thinking, resourcefulness, and serious grit. What began as a simple AR scene evolved into a full pipeline test: Blender → Unity → Animator → Scene Setup.

While not everything behaved as intended (yet), the process forged confidence and deeper understanding of how 3D assets become interactive experiences in XR.
