Question 1 
What is the main idea behind procedural generation for VR? Choose one (1).
==> The system generates content algorithmically, for example, as the user changes their virtual or physical location. 


Question 2 
How does redirected walking enable VR users to travel larger virtual spaces than can fit into the user’s real-world physical space? 
==> While walking, the user receives unnoticeable visual cues through manipulations of the VR scene, causing the user to compensate for scene motion by redirecting themselves without realizing this. 


Question 3
What are potential benefits of custom VR motion controllers?
==> Common VR controllers have a generic shape optimized for grip but are lacking the haptic feedback consistent with any virtual objects users may grasp in VR.
==> Common VR controllers assume able-bodied users but may not be accessible to users with motor impairments.


Question 4
Which steps are required for semantic understanding of the physical world as seen by an AR device? Choose all that apply.
==> Spatial mapping to create a mesh from the physical world in the form of a dense 3D point cloud
==> Object recognition to segment and extract objects from the mesh and assign classification labels


Question 5
What are key issues that require advanced techniques to support accessibility? Choose all that apply.
==> The system needs to perceive the physical world like a human would.
==> The system needs to describe the world to a user like a human would.


Question 6 
Why is text input a problem in VR/AR applications? Choose all that apply.
==> Virtual keyboards are usually not very efficient in VR or AR.
==> Physical keyboards are usually not assumed to be part of the VR/AR setup.


Question 7 
Why are sensing and input still key issues in XR research? Choose all that apply.
==> Current applications still only have limited understanding of a user’s environment and intent.
==> Better sensing and input techniques are required to better assist users with impairments.


Question 8 
What makes XR as a research topic particularly difficult? Choose one (1). 
==> It requires a combination of UX, programming, and research skills that is rare. 


Question 9 
When asking who we are designing for, what would be a better question to ask in research? Choose one (1). 
==> How can we design with them? 


Question 10
Which of the following are important design ethics questions? Choose all that apply. 
==> What is the role and responsibility of the XR designer?
==> How do we hold XR designers and developers accountable?
==> What happens when users misuse our design for unintended purposes?
==> What if users can’t tell what’s real and what’s virtual anymore?
