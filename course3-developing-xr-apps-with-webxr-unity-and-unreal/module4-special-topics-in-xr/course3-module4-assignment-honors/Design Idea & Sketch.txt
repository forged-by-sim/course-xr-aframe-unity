Design Idea & Sketch

In a few sentences, describe the main idea and inspiration for your 3D/VR/AR scene.

If possible, share the sketch based on which you modelled your work.

Even if you just submit a 3D scene without particular adaptations for AR/VR, make it clear whether you have been designing for AR or VR.

Design Idea & Sketch 

The idea was to create a living reconstruction of the Rhomaleosaurus, a prehistoric marine reptile, and place it in both virtual and real-world settings. Inspired by museum exhibits and natural history documentaries, I wanted users to experience the creature as if it were swimming through space, which was either inside a virtual viewer or anchored in their physical environment.

This scene was specifically designed for marker-less AR, allowing viewers to walk around the animated model using just a mobile device. A rough sketch guided the model’s pose and intended viewing angles.
