Envisioned AR/VR User Experience 

I envisioned an immersive experience where users could encounter a life-like Rhomaleosaurus either within a virtual museum viewer (VR) or anchored in their real-world space (AR). The key interactions included viewing the animated creature from multiple angles, observing its swimming motion, and engaging with the scene by physically moving around it, which created a sense of presence and natural exploration without the need for controllers or UI.
