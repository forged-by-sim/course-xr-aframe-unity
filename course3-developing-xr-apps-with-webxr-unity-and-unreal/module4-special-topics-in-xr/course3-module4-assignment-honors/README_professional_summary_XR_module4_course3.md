XR Course 3 – Module 4: Special Topics in Extended Reality

This final module explored emerging challenges and open questions in the XR space. While it did not include a hands-on development assignment, it prompted critical thinking around the direction of XR as a medium and its relationship to society.

📌 Topics Explored

Hardware evolution (e.g., passthrough AR, standalone headsets, MR devices)

Accessibility concerns in XR for users with mobility, sensory, or cognitive differences

XR for social impact, education, and mental health

XR ethics — simulation vs reality, empathy vs manipulation

Spatial privacy, surveillance, and future policies

🧠 Reflection

This module helped recontextualize all my previous technical work in terms of real-world impact. Building immersive experiences is exciting—but it also comes with responsibility. Whether we’re placing dinosaurs in living rooms or simulating medical procedures, XR design affects human perception, emotion, and behavior.

It was a reminder that “cool tech” should always be paired with thoughtful intent, inclusive design, and future-aware ethics.

✅ Completion Status

All prior modules (1–3) led up to this reflection. No code deliverables were submitted, but this module closed the loop between tools, design, deployment, and philosophy.
