Development Approach and Tools

State which XR platforms and tools you were using and briefly describe your development process and experience with the tools.

What are the key interactions you wanted to implement?

What were some of the design and technical challenges you had?

How close did you get towards your envisioned final AR/VR user experience with your 3D/VR/AR scene?

Development Approach and Tools 

I used Blender for rigging and animating the Rhomaleosaurus model, and initially attempted to deploy it in Unity for AR. Due to limitations with mobile playback, I pivoted to A-Frame (WebXR) for the VR viewer and MyWebAR for the final AR experience.

My goal was to implement a looped swimming animation and allow users to physically walk around the model using marker-less AR. The biggest challenge was achieving cross-platform compatibility while preserving animation playback.

In the end, I was able to fully realize my vision of a lightweight, immersive XR scene accessible on both desktop and mobile browsers.
