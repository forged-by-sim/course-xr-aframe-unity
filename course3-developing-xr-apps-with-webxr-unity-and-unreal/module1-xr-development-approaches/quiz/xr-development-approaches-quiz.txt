1. Which of the following things should you do before starting the development of your XR application? Choose all that apply.

=> Create digital prototypes to test interactions for implementation feasibility
=> Create storyboards and wireframes to flesh out design ideas
=> Construct personas to make it clear who you’re designing for and who you’re not designing for

==> WebXR is an emerging web standard designed to bring XR content to the web.
==> Unity has native support for XR and is the de facto standard for creating XR apps.
==> Unreal provides increasing support for XR but was not originally designed to be an XR tool.


3. Which of the following statements best describe A-Frame? Choose all that apply.

==> A-Frame is based on web standards and supports WebXR

5. Which of the following 3D transforms would spin a cube around its vertical axis?

==> rotation = (0,360,0)


6. Which of the following statements best describes what raycasting is?

==> In 3D, raycasting is a technique to determine which object is selected.


7. Which of the following best describes a 3D mesh?

==> The geometry or skin of a 3D model that describes its structural build.


8. What is required for creating immersive VR applications?

==> Environmental design including lights, physics, and spatial sound


9. Choose three (3) reasons why designing a VR application is potentially more difficult than designing traditional web or mobile applications.

==> There is a need for multi-sensory interaction to make it immersive.
==> There are many more degrees of freedom for user interaction.
==> There are major differences between VR devices.


10. What are the main differences between 3D and 360? Choose all that apply.

==> Unlike 360 content, 3D objects have width, height & depth.
==> Unlike 360 content, 3D objects react to light and physics.
