🛑 Failed Attempts & Debugging Notes (Unity / A-Frame)

A transparent log of all errors, false starts, and problems encountered during the Rhomaleosaurus WebXR prototype.

This section documents every major issue encountered while building the interactive Rhomaleosaurus viewer in A-Frame — including model failures, invisible objects, CORS errors, scaling bugs, and broken lighting. These notes serve as a technical “paper trail” for hiring managers and future collaborators to see how problems were diagnosed and solved.

1. Model Invisible in Scene (A-Frame)

The very first issue was that the Rhomaleosaurus model simply never appeared, even though:

The red cube appeared,

The grey plane appeared,

The scene rendered normally,

And there were no syntax errors.

Attempts made:

Adjusted model scale from extremely small values to extremely large ones.

Moved the model closer and farther on all axes.

Rotated the model in multiple directions.

Toggled visible on and off.

Rewrote the gltf-model path.

Tried .gltf and .glb versions of the model.

Used lighting adjustments to see if the model was lost in darkness.

Checked A-Frame Inspector to confirm the entity existed.

Outcome:
No model appeared. This was the first sign that the model was not being loaded at all.

2. File Dragging Behaving Incorrectly

When attempting to drag .glb files into Chrome for testing, the browser simply downloaded the file again instead of previewing it.

Repeated attempts:

Dragging into a new Chrome tab,

Dragging into an existing tab,

Trying Edge,

Trying Firefox.

Outcome:
All browsers downloaded the file instead of displaying it. This suggested Windows did not have proper MIME handling for .glb.

3. Opening the GLB in Chrome Failed

Double-clicking the .glb file:

Caused Windows to ask which application to open it with,

Or opened a blank tab,

Or triggered a download.

Outcome:
Could not confirm the model’s integrity via the browser.

4. Flat Rhomaleosaurus Fossil Model

The original Rhomaleosaurus model from Google Arts & Culture was a flat fossil slab — not a full 3D creature.
This made it unusable for animation or VR placement.

Symptoms:

“Invisible” appearance unless seen at the exact right angle,

Lighting could not cast shadows or define depth,

Material looked like a scanned photograph,

Imported mesh showed almost no thickness.

Attempts:

Scaling in all directions,

Rotating to find a “depth” angle,

Increasing lighting intensity.

Outcome:
Model was not appropriate for VR animation — it was 2D masquerading as 3D.

5. A-Frame Inspector Showing No Geometry

When opening the inspector, the a-entity containing the model appeared in the scene graph, but:

It had no visible mesh,

No children nodes,

No LOD groups,

No bounding box.

Attempts:

Selecting the node,

Applying transformations live,

Toggling wireframe mode,

Adding debug spheres and axes.

Outcome:
Still no visible geometry. This indicated the loader never successfully loaded the model file.

6. CORS Policy Blocking GLB Files

Once the browser console was opened, the first major error appeared:

“Access to fetch at file:///…/pistosaur.glb from origin null has been blocked by CORS policy.”

This error explained everything:

A-Frame cannot load local files via file://.

A local or hosted server is required.

Attempts before discovering the root cause:

Renaming file paths,

Placing models in different folders,

Copy-pasting code from documentation,

Rewriting the gltf-model syntax,

Adding url() wrappers.

Outcome:
Issue persisted until a local server was used.

7. Running Without a Local Server

Before the Python server fix, every model load attempt resulted in:

Silent failures,

Invisible geometry,

Missing animation states.

Attempts included:

Refreshing the page,

Clearing cache,

Restarting Chrome,

Moving the project folder to Desktop / OneDrive / Documents,

Renaming folders to avoid spaces.

Outcome:
Completely resolved after starting a Python server.

8. Model Appearing as a Tiny Speck

After CORS was fixed, the first visible version of the model appeared as a microscopic dot that wouldn’t disappear even when toggling visibility. This caused confusion because:

It appeared like a ghost entity,

It looked detached from the model,

It wasn’t affected by scale changes.

Attempts:

Scaling from 1 → 100 → 1,000 → 10,000 → 100,000,

Moving model in multiple directions,

Checking material overrides,

Resetting rotation.

Outcome:
This “speck” was actually a bounding sphere or particle artifact — not the dinosaur itself.

9. Incorrect Pivot Point and Origin

Even after the model became visible, it spawned in:

A location far behind the camera,

A different coordinate space than the default origin.

Attempts:

Moving position to (0, 0, 0),

Raising Y position,

Pulling it forward with negative Z values,

Nudging it left/right to find the body.

Outcome:
Correct position found:
position="0 2 -0.1".

10. Model Facing Away From the Camera

When the dinosaur finally appeared, it was swimming directly away from the viewer.

Attempts:

Rotations of 90°, 180°, 270°,

Flipping axes,

Inverting directions.

Outcome:
Rotation was corrected with:
rotation="0 180 0".

11. Animation Not Playing Initially

The model appeared, but it was completely frozen despite being labeled “animated”.

Attempts:

Adding A-Frame animations,

Applying <a-animation> tags,

Trying idle movement manually,

Checking Sketchfab export settings.

Outcome:
Real reason: A-Frame does not auto-play embedded GLTF animations.
Fix: adding animation-mixer to the entity.

12. Orbit Controls Not Working Initially

Early attempts using orbit controls produced:

No camera rotation,

Sudden snapping,

Camera drifting through the ground.

Cause:

Missing aframe-extras script,

Incorrect rig setup,

Wrong camera nesting.

Attempts:

Multiple camera entity configurations,

Wrapping the camera inside another entity,

Providing a target that didn't exist yet.

Outcome:
Resolved after importing aframe-extras and targeting #rhomaleosaurus.

✔️ Conclusion

These failed attempts were not setbacks—they were necessary steps in understanding how A-Frame loads models, handles animation, enforces security policies, and interprets coordinate systems.

The completed WebXR scene exists because of these errors:

CORS issues taught proper server setup.

Invisible models taught debugging with inspector tools.

Flat fossil models taught asset selection.

Scaling and positioning failures taught world-space reasoning.

Animation issues taught GLTF workflows.

Orbit camera failures taught camera rigging and input control.

This transparency is what transforms a student project into a professional XR case study.
