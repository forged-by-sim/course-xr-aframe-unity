# 🧱 Course 3 – Developing XR Applications with WebXR, Unity, and Unreal  
**Specialization:** Extended Reality for Everybody (University of Michigan)   
**Repository:** `course-xr-developing-xr-apps-with-webxr-unity-and-unreal`  

## 🎯 About This Course

This capstone course focuses on the hands-on development of immersive XR scenes using modern tools: **Blender**, **Unity**, and **A-Frame/WebXR**. It taught me how to bring my earlier UX concepts and prototypes (from Course 2) into **functional VR and AR experiences**.  

My work in this course culminated in a fully documented project that takes the user on a **museum-to-ocean transformation journey**, centered on the Rhomaleosaurus — a prehistoric sea dragon I modeled, rigged, and animated for WebXR, VR, and AR platforms.  

Each module is professionally documented, including **design decisions**, **technical challenges**, **troubleshooting logs**, and **project outcomes**.

## 🧾 Modules Summary

### ✅ Module 1 – 3D Viewer in A-Frame (WebXR Foundation)  
**Summary:**  
Built a WebXR-based 3D viewer using A-Frame. The process involved debugging invisible models, CORS issues, animation-mixer setup, and orbit controls. After many iterations, I successfully implemented a swimming dino scene in the browser using the animation-ready GLB.  

**Key Tools:** A-Frame, GLB, animation-mixer, aframe-extras

### ✅ Module 2 – VR Scene in Unity (Blender → Unity Pipeline)  
**Summary:**  
Imported the rigged Rhomaleosaurus from Blender into Unity and created a functioning VR viewer. Overcame broken prefab imports, FBX visibility issues, and armature scaling bugs. Used Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit and recorder to capture the VR scene for showcase.  

**Key Tools:** Unity, FBX, Blender rigging, XR rig, Recorder

### ✅ Module 3 – AR Scene with MyWebAR (WebAR Deployment)  
**Summary:**  
After Unity AR builds failed to animate on mobile, I pivoted to MyWebAR to create a clean, browser-based AR scene with the animated Rhomaleosaurus. I recorded live AR demos and deployed via QR code for mobile accessibility.  

**Key Tools:** MyWebAR, A-Frame (initial attempts), Unity (early failures), GLB

### ✅ Module 4 – Special Topics in XR (Ethics, Accessibility, Future Tech)  
**Summary:**  
This was a reflection-based module exploring XR ethics, inclusive design, and the future of immersive computing. It serves as a conceptual close to the specialization and adds philosophical context to my technical work.

## 🔚 Final Outcome

By the end of this course, I had:  
✅ Developed three complete XR scenes (WebXR, VR, and AR)  
✅ Created a Blender-to-Unity-to-WebAR pipeline  
✅ Documented all debugging, design decisions, and learning outcomes  
✅ Turned a Coursera project into a **portfolio-ready XR case study**  

These modules now form the technical backbone of my simulation design work — bridging UX, immersive interaction, and deployment strategies across XR platforms.
