# 🎓 Extended Reality for Everybody  
**Institution:** University of Michigan (Coursera)  
**GitHub Portfolio Series:** XR Specialization (Courses 1–3)

---

## 🧠 Overview

This three-course specialization introduced me to the **technologies, principles, and development workflows** behind immersive experiences in XR — spanning **AR (Augmented Reality)**, **VR (Virtual Reality)**, **MR (Mixed Reality)**, and the broader umbrella of **Extended Reality**.

With a background in **simulation technology and biomedical sciences**, I entered this program seeking not just technical skills, but a **philosophical and design-first foundation** in immersive environments. Over the span of this specialization, I:

- Explored real-world XR applications
- Designed interactive scenes through sketches, dioramas, and prototypes
- Developed working 3D, VR, and AR scenes using Unity, Blender, A-Frame, and WebXR pipelines
- Centered all work around the concept of **transformative learning experiences**, embodied in my evolving Rhomaleosaurus project

Each course builds on the last — moving from **foundational concepts**, to **design workflows**, to **fully functional XR deployment**.

## 📦 Course Breakdown

### ✅ [Course 1 – Intro to AR/VR/MR/XR: Technologies, Applications & Issues](./course-xr-intro-to-xr-technologies-applications-issues)  
📍 *“What is XR, and why does it matter?”*  

Explored XR classification, real-world app evaluations, and ethical implications of immersive tech. Assignments included app critiques (Seek by iNaturalist, Complete Anatomy), species observation documentation, and reflections on the future of XR.

📄 Modules:  
- Module 1: App Classification & Analysis  
- Module 2: XR Visualization Tools (Complete Anatomy)  
- Module 3: Impact & Ethical Considerations  
- Module 4: XR Strategy (Light Reflection)

### ✅ [Course 2 – User Experience & Interaction Design for AR/VR/MR/XR](./course-xr-ux-interaction-design)  
📍 *“How do we design XR experiences that feel natural, meaningful, and human?”*  

Introduced the XR design process: user-centered design, gaze interaction, presence, and emotional flow. The Rhomaleosaurus concept originated here — through storyboarding, museum-scene dioramas, interface redesigns, and digital prototyping.

📄 Modules:  
- Module 1: XR Design Process Foundations (Reflection)  
- Module 2: Interaction Redesign (Inspired by Google’s Sea Dragon)  
- Module 3: Spatial Storyboarding + Diorama Construction  
- Module 4: Digital Prototype + Peer Review

### ✅ [Course 3 – Developing XR Applications with WebXR, Unity, and Unreal](./course-xr-developing-xr-apps-with-webxr-unity-and-unreal)  
📍 *“Can I bring my immersive ideas to life in code and 3D space?”*  

This capstone course guided me through hands-on XR scene development using Blender, Unity, and A-Frame. I created three complete scenes — a 3D model viewer in WebXR, a VR scene in Unity, and a WebAR scene in MyWebAR — all centered on the Rhomaleosaurus.

🔗 [View course repo](./course-xr-developing-xr-apps-with-webxr-unity-and-unreal)  
📄 Modules:  
- Module 1: WebXR 3D Viewer (A-Frame + animation mixer)  
- Module 2: Unity VR Scene (rigged model, prefab, recorder)  
- Module 3: Mobile AR Scene (MyWebAR deployment + video capture)  
- Module 4: Ethics & XR Futures (Reflection)

## 🦴 The Rhomaleosaurus Project

Across Courses 2 and 3, I developed and deployed an original educational XR experience — inspired by Google Arts & Culture’s “Bring the Rhomaleosaurus Sea Dragon Back to Life.”

Over time, the project evolved from:
- Interface redesign sketches →  
- Storyboarded scene flow →  
- Physical dioramas →  
- Digital prototypes →  
- Fully functional XR scenes in WebXR, Unity VR, and AR

The Rhomaleosaurus became my creative anchor — a prehistoric creature brought back to life through simulation, storytelling, and immersive design.

## 🧠 Final Reflection

This specialization didn’t just teach me XR tools — it reshaped how I think about space, learning, and interaction.

As I move toward simulation engineering roles in aerospace, medical training, and interactive education, this foundation supports my goal to build **immersive, science-rooted experiences** that spark curiosity and respect the human at the center of the simulation.

📣 *Built with presence, purpose, and prehistoric power.*
